We are very happy and honoured of starting today our Marie-Sklodwoska Curie Project at University of Ja√©n.

The title of our project is: "Fairness and Explanations in Group Recommender Systems. Towards Trustworthiness and transparency"

The overall objectives of our project are:

-To develop a post-hoc explanation model for recommendation, based on local-agnostic models.

-To study and develop models to improve C-fairness, P-fairness, and two-sided fairness in recommendation.

-To develop post-hoc models for the local-agnostic explanation of C-, P-, and two-sided fairness in recommendation.
